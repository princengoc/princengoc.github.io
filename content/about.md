## About Me

I am a data-driven mathematician. My passion is to solve hard quantitative problems, be it from [neuroscience](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08533), [auctions theory](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/moor.2018.0975), [economics](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/19M1304295), [hydrology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06197), finance, [ambulance routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11208), [statistical learning theory](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/20M1354490?journalCode=sjmdaq), [semigroup theory](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021869319301723), [random polynomials](https://www.ams.org/journals/tran/2016-368-10/S0002-9947-2016-06565-4/home.html) or [forecasting the evolution of AI with AI](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-023-00735-0). I thrive at using discrete, combinatorial, and optimization techniques for unconventional problems where their application is not immediately apparent.

#### My academic career (-2021)

By my early 30s, I had been very fortunate to experience the full, typical trajectory of academia: from being a PhD student to mentoring them, from reading about to solving decade-old conjectures, and from working in to creating my own field. I became a friend, mentor, and mentee to many wonderful people. The community I was (am?) a part of, tropical geometry, has been incredibly collaborative and collegial. 

Those are the parts I love about academia. And then of course, there is the icky part of every job. The publications process, the grants-writing, the bureaucracy. Being a method-agnostic, data-driven omnivore, I find it hard to "fit in" any community. End of 2020, my student [Yangxinyu Xie](https://xieyangxinyu.github.io/) and I did an [IEEE BigData competition](https://www.iarai.ac.at/science4cast/). We lost the lead in the last few days to [Yichao Liu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yichaolu/?originalSubdomain=ca), an industry expert on recommender systems. At the winner's conference, he asked me: "You guys had a single learner? If you ran XGBoost you would have won". Maybe. I wouldn't know, because I didn't have the resources to run XGBoost. "It's time to find out", I thought to myself. So I said "yes" when industry came knocking. 

#### Finance (2021-)

Since 2021 I have worked at the [Chicago Trading Company](https://www.chicagotrading.com) as a quantative researcher. My work is mostly portfolio optimization for options trading.

Here is a couple of books I learned of since joining CTC and enjoy reading

* [Quantitative Portfolio Management](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Quantitative+Portfolio+Management%3A+The+Art+and+Science+of+Statistical+Arbitrage-p-9781119821328)
* [Trades, Quotes and Prices](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/trades-quotes-and-prices/029A71078EE4C41C0D5D4574211AB1B5)


#### Hobby projects: data competitions

I sometimes do Kaggle-style data competitions for fun. 

* 2nd place, [Science4Cast](https://www.iarai.ac.at/science4cast/). Ngoc Tran and Yangxinyu Xie.
* 2nd place, [NeurIPS 2023 CityLearn Challenge](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/neurips-2023-citylearn-challenge/problems/forecasting-track-citylearn-challenge/leaderboards). Tanwi Mallick, Ngoc Tran, Yangxinyu Xie.

### Bucket list

> Thoughts become things.

Eventually, I'd like to do these things. 

- [-] Start my own company. 
- [-] Get better at a number of languages, both human and machines
- [-] Run a non-profit that teaches competitive math/stat/coding to low-income primary and middle school students. 
- [-] Volunteer for [WWOOF](https://wwoof.net/).
