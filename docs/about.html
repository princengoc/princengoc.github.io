<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am a data-driven mathematician. My passion is to solve hard quantitative problems, be it from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08533">neuroscience</a>, <a href="https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/moor.2018.0975">auctions theory</a>, <a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/19M1304295">economics</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06197">hydrology</a>, finance, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11208">ambulance routing</a>, <a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/20M1354490?journalCode=sjmdaq">statistical learning theory</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021869319301723">semigroup theory</a>, <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/tran/2016-368-10/S0002-9947-2016-06565-4/home.html">random polynomials</a> or <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-023-00735-0">forecasting the evolution of AI with AI</a>. I thrive at using discrete, combinatorial, and optimization techniques for unconventional problems where their application is not immediately apparent.</p>

<h4>My academic career (-2021)</h4>
<p>By my early 30s, I had been very fortunate to experience the full, typical trajectory of academia: from being a PhD student to mentoring them, from reading about to solving decade-old conjectures, and from working in to creating my own field. I became a friend, mentor, and mentee to many wonderful people. The community I was (am?) a part of, tropical geometry, has been incredibly collaborative and collegial. </p>
<p>Those are the parts I love about academia. And then of course, there is the icky part of every job. The publications process, the grants-writing, the bureaucracy. Being a method-agnostic, data-driven omnivore, I find it hard to &ldquo;fit in&rdquo; any community. End of 2020, my student <a href="https://xieyangxinyu.github.io/">Yangxinyu Xie</a> and I did an <a href="https://www.iarai.ac.at/science4cast/">IEEE BigData competition</a>. We lost the lead in the last few days to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yichaolu/?originalSubdomain=ca">Yichao Liu</a>, an industry expert on recommender systems. At the winner&rsquo;s conference, he asked me: &ldquo;You guys had a single learner? If you ran XGBoost you would have won&rdquo;. Maybe. I wouldn&rsquo;t know, because I didn&rsquo;t have the resources to run XGBoost. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to find out&rdquo;, I thought to myself. So I said &ldquo;yes&rdquo; when industry came knocking. </p>
<h4>Finance (2021-)</h4>
<p>Since 2021 I have worked at the <a href="https://www.chicagotrading.com">Chicago Trading Company</a> as a quantative researcher. My work is mostly portfolio optimization for options trading.</p>
<p>Here is a couple of books I learned of since joining CTC and enjoy reading</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Quantitative+Portfolio+Management%3A+The+Art+and+Science+of+Statistical+Arbitrage-p-9781119821328">Quantitative Portfolio Management</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/trades-quotes-and-prices/029A71078EE4C41C0D5D4574211AB1B5">Trades, Quotes and Prices</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>Hobby projects: data competitions</h4>
<p>I sometimes do Kaggle-style data competitions for fun. </p>
<ul>
<li>2nd place, <a href="https://www.iarai.ac.at/science4cast/">Science4Cast</a>. Ngoc Tran and Yangxinyu Xie.</li>
<li>2nd place, <a href="https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/neurips-2023-citylearn-challenge/problems/forecasting-track-citylearn-challenge/leaderboards">NeurIPS 2023 CityLearn Challenge</a>. Tanwi Mallick, Ngoc Tran, Yangxinyu Xie.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bucket list</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Thoughts become things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eventually, I&rsquo;d like to do these things. </p>
<ul>
<li>[-] Start my own company. </li>
<li>[-] Get better at a number of languages, both human and machines</li>
<li>[-] Run a non-profit that teaches competitive math/stat/coding to low-income primary and middle school students. </li>
<li>[-] Volunteer for <a href="https://wwoof.net/">WWOOF</a>. </li>
</ul>
