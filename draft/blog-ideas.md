# What is lost with AI assistants: internship projects that we grew up with

I partially paid my way through undergrad by doing statistical consulting work. That kind of work will mostly be automated away now with GPT. So how would future statisticians gain their skills? 

# Data competitions vs stats consuling vs actual problems solving

I partially paid my way through undergrad by being a statistical consultant. Those projects are super fun, especially when the experiment is so clean, the data so well-collected, that you can deliver results with the simplest of methodologies. Those are the most rewarding projects. The other fun part is problem formulation. I love learning about the problem's domain, it helps me keep a beginner's mind. 

Data competitions are fun in a different way: I like the intensity, the long hours of flipping the problem over and make incremental improvements before getting a mini break-through. Unlike real-world problems, there's no room for feedback. Sometimes the data or the problem statement have flaws, and those bugs just become features. 

Science4Cast consumed me (and Xiyu) over a couple of months. The load forecasting was less so.
