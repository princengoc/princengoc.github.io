<hr>

<b> Course description </b>: Tropical geometry is the interface of matroid theory, combinatorial optimization and algebraic geometry. It has found numerous applications in auction theory, mechanism design, game theory, complexity theory, discrete convex analysis. In particular, tropical geometry is a variational version of combinatorial optimization, where it examines the combinatorics and geometry of the entire space of input parameters, as opposed to analyzing the solution of a particular instance. It is an excellent tool for constructing examples and counter-examples in economics, game theory, network optimization, matroid theory and algebraic geometry.

This course aims to take students to the latest open research questions as fast as possible. After a set of introductory lectures, the majority of class time will be spent doing survey papers and literature review of existing research directions and student presentations on progress to open problems.
<br><br>
<b>Lectures</b>: TBA  <br>
<br>
<b>Instructor</b>: Ngoc Tran (office 11.124 PMA)<br>
<br>
<b>Office hours</b>: TBA<br>
<br>
<b>Prerequisites</b>: graduate students in mathematics, electrical engineering, or consent of instructor
<br><br>
<b>Grading policy</b>: homework sets and final projects.
<br><br>
<b>Class format</b>: the class breaks up to essentially disjoint topics. On each topic, I will give a set of core lectures, and list a bunch of open problems. Students will choose at least two topics to dwelve further upon. On each of their chosen topics, they need to either write a survey or work on a specific open problem (could be of their own suggestion). Afterwards, they will present progress to the class.
